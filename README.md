Some dotfiles.

After cloning you may want to:
   1. Symlink the desired dotfiles into their respective places. If you cloned into `~/dotfiles` then `setup_symlinks.sh` will try to create all symlinks, overwriting existing dotfiles if you agree to their removal.
   2. Add any workspace bindings you want to `dotfiles/i3/config` (there is a TODO marking where to do this).
   3. Symlink your favorite wallpaper to `~/.wallpaper`.
   4. Install the MediterraneanNight gtk theme. This may include symlinking MediterraneanNight's `gtk-3.0` folder to your `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory (`~/.config` by default).
